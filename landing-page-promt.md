# Landing Page Redesign Request

## Current Status
- This is the current landing page of my website.
- I‚Äôve attached images/screenshots for reference.

## Project Overview
- This website is focused on A fun, mobile-friendly web app that lets users save and organize food recipe videos from platforms like Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, with a sprinkle of AI magic. Just paste a video link, and the app will: üîó Embed or download the video üß† Use AI to extract ingredients directly from the video (audio and visuals ‚Äî not scraped from the internet!) üçΩÔ∏è Auto-organize recipes by meal type (like Starters, Mains) and estimated cooking time üíæ Save your favorite food videos in one place for easy access and replay üí° Why? We all save food videos but never actually find them again ‚Äî this project makes it fun and easy to watch, cook, and organize recipes from short-form content, all without switching apps or digging through social media bookmarks..
