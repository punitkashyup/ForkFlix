# ðŸŽ¯ Claude Code Prompt: Multi-Modal Recipe Accuracy System

## ðŸ“‹ **PROJECT ENHANCEMENT BRIEF**

**Objective**: Enhance the existing Instagram Recipe Manager with **multi-modal AI extraction** to dramatically improve recipe accuracy by combining text, visual, and audio analysis.

**Current Problem**: Recipe extraction from Instagram posts is inaccurate because we only use basic text parsing. We need to combine multiple data sources for better results.

**Target Accuracy**: Increase recipe extraction accuracy from ~40% to ~85%+ by using progressive enhancement approach.

## ðŸ§  **MULTI-MODAL EXTRACTION STRATEGY**

### **Data Source Priority System**
Create a layered extraction approach with two phases:

**IMMEDIATE LAYER (Under 2 seconds)**
- Source: Text Analysis from Title/Caption/Description
- Accuracy: 60-70%
- User Experience: Instant results that user can immediately review and edit

**ENHANCED LAYER (15-30 seconds)**
- Source: Video Frame Analysis + Audio Transcription + Advanced NLP
- Accuracy: 85-95% 
- User Experience: Background processing with progressive updates

### **Progressive Enhancement User Flow**
1. User pastes Instagram URL
2. Show instant text-based extraction results within 2 seconds
3. Allow user to review and edit while AI processes video in background
4. Progressively update results as video/audio analysis completes
5. Smart merge of enhanced results with any user edits
6. Show confidence indicators for each extracted field

## ðŸŽ¨ **USER EXPERIENCE SPECIFICATIONS**

### **Progressive Loading States Design**
Create visual feedback for each extraction phase:

**Phase 1: Analyzing Text (1-2 seconds)**
- Icon: Document/text symbol
- Message: "Reading caption and description..."
- Progress: 25%

**Phase 2: Processing Video (10-15 seconds)** 
- Icon: Video/camera symbol
- Message: "Analyzing video frames for ingredients..."
- Progress: 65%

**Phase 3: Extracting Audio (5-10 seconds)**
- Icon: Audio/microphone symbol  
- Message: "Transcribing cooking instructions..."
- Progress: 85%

**Phase 4: Fusing Data (2-3 seconds)**
- Icon: Brain/merge symbol
- Message: "Combining all sources for best results..."
- Progress: 100%

### **Smart Editing Interface Design**
For each recipe field (name, ingredients, instructions), create:
- Current extracted value display
- Confidence score indicator (color-coded)
- AI alternative suggestions
- Source attribution (text/visual/audio/user-edited)
- Easy user override functionality
- Smart merge notifications when new data arrives

---

## ðŸ”¬ **DATA FUSION ALGORITHM STRATEGY**

### **Confidence-Based Merging Logic**
Create intelligent algorithm to combine multiple extraction sources:
- Prioritize user edits over all AI suggestions
- Weight AI results by confidence scores
- Handle conflicts between different sources intelligently
- Provide transparency about data source for each field

### **Conflict Resolution Rules**
Define clear rules for handling conflicting data:
- Recipe Name: Prefer text if high confidence, otherwise use visual
- Ingredients: Union all sources with smart deduplication
- Cooking Time: Prefer explicit text mentions, fallback to visual estimation
- Instructions: Merge in chronological order from all sources
- Dietary Info: Only include if multiple sources agree

---

## ðŸ“Š **VIDEO FRAME ANALYSIS STRATEGY**

### **Smart Frame Sampling Approach**
Extract video frames strategically based on cooking video patterns:
- Ingredient preparation scenes (beginning 30% of video)
- Active cooking process (middle 50% of video)
- Final dish presentation (final 20% of video)

### **Multi-Model Ingredient Detection**
Implement layered computer vision approach:
- Object detection to find ingredient regions in frames
- Classification to identify specific ingredients
- OCR for any visible text/measurements
- Confidence scoring for detection reliability
- Smart deduplication across multiple frames

---

## ðŸŽ§ **AUDIO PROCESSING STRATEGY**

### **Speech-to-Text for Cooking Instructions**
Process Instagram reel audio tracks:
- Extract audio from video files
- Transcribe speech using Whisper model (free via Hugging Face)
- Filter transcription for cooking-related content
- Extract step-by-step instructions from speech
- Identify cooking verbs, time indicators, temperature mentions

### **Audio Content Filtering**
Use NLP to identify cooking-relevant speech:
- Cooking action words: add, mix, cook, heat, stir, etc.
- Time indicators: "for 5 minutes", "until golden brown"
- Temperature mentions: "medium heat", "350 degrees"
- Ingredient mentions that match visual detection
