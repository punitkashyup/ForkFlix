For full recipe extraction from video content, you'd need:

  1. Video frame analysis - Extract ingredients from visual frames
  2. Audio transcription - Convert speech to text for instructions
  3. Computer vision models - Identify cooking steps, ingredients, utensils

  The current setup is more lightweight - it works with publicly available text metadata rather than processing actual video files, which        
  would require:
  - Much more complex AI models
  - Significantly higher processing costs
  - Video download and storage capabilitie
